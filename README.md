## Description

    For this project, we were required to create a professional README generator using node.js. Using the starter code provided, we needed to prompt a user to input certain information that we could use to help create the new README file. Once the user has answered all the prompted questions, a new README file will be created for the user to use for their project.

##  Challenges

    The biggest challenged that I faced during this homework assignment was figuring out the license badge and link function. Initially, the badges selected would not show up in the README when generated, as well as the links. I was also unable to use the renderLicenseSection function, but was still able to complete the assignment by calling the renderLicenseBadge and renderLicenseLink functions separately.

## Usage

    1) Make sure you change into the directory that houses index.js
    2) Run node index.js
    3) When prompted, insert the title for the project
    4) When prompted, insert the description of the project
    5) When prompted, insert how to use the project
    6) When prompted, insert the contributors to the project
    7) When prompted, insert how to test the project
    8) When prompted, choose which license the project is covered on
    9) When prompted, insert your GitHub username
    10) When prompted, insert your GitHub profile link
    11) When prompted, insert your email address
    12) The new README file will then be generated
